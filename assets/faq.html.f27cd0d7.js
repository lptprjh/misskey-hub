For details, please check <a href="./apps">here</a>.</p><p>However, functionality of third-party applications will inevitably lag behind the official Web client, so unless you really want to use a native application, we recommend the official Web client instead. As the Misskey Web client supports PWA, it is also possible to make it act as if it was a native application instead.
